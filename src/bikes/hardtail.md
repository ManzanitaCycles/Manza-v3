## Max fun on the trail

Your Manzanita hardtail will be designed and built for you. The fit, geometry, and tubing selection will be tuned for your weight, riding style, and frame size.

You can choose how much fork travel you want the frame designed for: from a fully rigid bikepacker to a 150mm battleship.

And if you want to take your hardtail bikepacking, you can request mounts for a custom, bolt-on frame bag and extra water bottles.

Starting at **$2,499**
