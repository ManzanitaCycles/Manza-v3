Ellen's hardtail is made for cruising dirt roads and the occasional bikepacking trip.

For this bike she prioritized comfort. The high rise Stooge Moto Bars and the PNW Components Coast suspension dropper post give an upright riding position with a little suspended cushioning on rougher dirt roads.

The Shimano XT brakes and Sram Eagle 12-speed drivetrain are durable and reliable.

The geometry is designed around the Fox 32 100mm 29er fork. While most of her riding won't be on singletrack, the bike is still capable on more technical terrain.
